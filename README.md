Soon after, Laura's classmate Ronette Pulaski is found beaten in a fugue state, prompting idiosyncratic FBI Agent Dale Cooper to travel to Twin Peaks to assist Sheriff Harry S. Truman in the investigation. Finding a piece of paper under Laura's fingernail bearing the letter \"R\", Cooper suspects a serial killer responsible for a similar murder one year earlier may have struck again. Discerning from Laura's diary and her best friend Donna Hayward that Laura was having an affair and was a cocaine addict, Cooper suspects more sinister goings-on in Twin Peaks than meet the eye. Truman arrests Laura's boyfriend, Bobby Briggs, who is having an affair with married woman Shelly Johnson. Deputies Andy Brennan and Tommy \"Hawk\" Hill discover the crime scene: an abandoned railway car containing half a locket and \"Fire walk with me\" written in blood. Overhearing her parents talking with Truman, Donna realizes that James Hurley, Lauraâ€™s secret lover, has the other half of the locket and persuades him to bury it. Laura's mother Sarah Palmer has a nightmare depicting an unseen figure unearthing the locket."
